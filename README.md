> What starts as simple deployment quickly spirals into inefficient architectures costing 40-60% more than needed, security blind spots risking customer data, and team burnout from operations instead of product development.

## New in version 2!

- Added support for L1 constructs snippets in AWS CDK Python! Open up a CDK Python project and type `l1` to trigger the L1 construct autocomplete.

## Features

1. **Comprehensive Support**: Seamlessly integrates all CloudFormation resources as L1 constructs within CDK, ensuring you have access to the latest AWS offerings.
2. **Effortless Autocomplete**: Activate autocomplete with `l1-<cloudformation-resource>` to streamline your coding process.
3. **Weekly Updates**: Construct snippets are refreshed weekly in line with AWS's updates to their [CloudFormation Resource Specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html), keeping you on the cutting edge.
4. **Placeholder Support**: Navigate efficiently through resource properties using the `Tab` key, thanks to built-in placeholder functionality.
5. **Required Property Highlighting**: Easily identify mandatory properties, highlighted with a `// required` comment for your convenience.
6. **Documentation at Your Fingertips**: Access the corresponding CDK resource documentation directly from the autocomplete prompt, enriching your development experience.

## Usage

1. Install the [CDK Snippets extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dannysteenman.cdk-snippets) in VS Code.
2. Open your CDK project (TypeScript or Python).
3. Add L1 constructs using their short prefix (e.g. `l1-s3-bucket` for `s3.CfnBucket`).

Example:

![CDK Construct Snippets example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannysteenman/vscode-cdk-snippets/main/images/cdk-snippet-tutorial.gif)

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 3), the corresponding snippet shows up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 3).
